  <h2>Our <span>Mission</span></h2>
  <p>
    We believe that children in the borough of Lambeth between the ages of one and twenty-one have the right to play freely and safely in a healthy outdoor environment. We believe such activity is important to their social, mental and physical well being and as such contributes to their present and future lives.5
