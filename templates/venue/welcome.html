  If you are looking for educational outdoor spaces, <a href="\contact-us"><span class='theme-txt'>contact us</span></a> to discuss using our Octopus 
  facility with its covered (weatherproof) space in the edible garden. Itâ€™s instant inspiration
    for experiential nature-based poetry writing or an applied biology lesson. What will you 
    teach your students here? Alternatively, it would be a wonderful location for a work 
    retreat or yoga!
